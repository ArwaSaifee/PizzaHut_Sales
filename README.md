Project Title: Analysis of Pizza Hut Sales Data

Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze Pizza Hut’s sales data to gain insights into customer orders, menu performance, and operational patterns. Using a structured relational database with four key tables—order_details, orders, pizza_types, and pizzas—the project aimed to answer fundamental business questions to drive decision-making.

Data Structure:
	1.	order_details:
	•	Contains information about individual items in each order, including quantities, sizes, and prices.
	2.	orders:
	•	Stores details of customer orders, such as order dates, times, and total amounts.
	3.	pizza_types:
	•	Describes the various pizza types available, including their names, descriptions, and categories (e.g., vegetarian, non-vegetarian).
	4.	pizzas:
	•	Provides details about pizza sizes and their corresponding prices.

Key Questions Answered:
	1.	Order Trends:
	•	What are the busiest days and times for orders?
	•	How do sales vary across different seasons or time periods?
	2.	Menu Performance:
	•	Which pizza types and sizes are most popular?
	•	Are there any underperforming pizzas that could be replaced or improved?
	3.	Customer Insights:
	•	What is the average order size and value?
	•	Do customers show preferences for specific pizza types based on location or timing?
	4.	Operational Efficiency:
	•	Are there peak order times that require additional staff or resources?
	•	How does pricing impact sales for different pizza sizes or types?

Tools and Techniques:
	•	Database Management: SQL queries were used to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from the relational database.
	•	Descriptive Analytics: Basic statistical measures, such as averages, totals, and percentages, were calculated to summarize data.

Outcomes:
The project provided actionable insights into customer behavior, menu performance, and operational trends. These findings could help Pizza Hut optimize its menu offerings, pricing strategy, and resource allocation to enhance customer satisfaction and profitability.
